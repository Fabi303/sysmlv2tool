HIGH — Will silently break on upstream API changes
1. [FIXED] SysML2PlantUMLText — blind constructor reflection (DiagramCommand.createViz())

createViz() now uses injector.getInstance(SysML2PlantUMLText.class) via the Guice injector. SysML2PlantUMLText is imported directly. No constructor iteration remains.

2. [FIXED] SysML2PlantUMLText — 7-name method fallback chain (DiagramCommand.generatePlantUML())

generatePlantUML() now calls createViz().sysML2PUML(List<EObject>) directly. The fallback chain is gone. The correct API method is documented in the class-level comment.

3. [OPEN] Private field access in SysMLEngineHelper — injector field

setAccessible(true) is still used to read SysMLInteractive's private static injector field (SysMLEngineHelper.java, around line 100). The code comment acknowledges that SysMLInteractive does not expose a public getInjector() method, making this an upstream API gap. The index-field access mentioned originally appears to have been removed. The injector reflection remains the only unresolved HIGH item.

4. [FIXED] getResourceSet() and getRootElement() called via reflection

Both are now called as direct method invocations. Reflection for these methods was removed in commit 8b508f3.

MEDIUM — Breaks on metamodel refactoring
5. [FIXED] Hardcoded metamodel type names as strings

All eClass().getName().equals/contains() type dispatch replaced with generated model type checks (org.omg.sysml.lang.sysml.*):
- DiagramCommand.isPackageLike(): uses exact EClass identity via SysMLPackage.eINSTANCE — instanceof cannot be used here because Package/LibraryPackage/Namespace are supertypes of almost every SysML element (Requirements, Parts, etc. all extend Namespace)
- DiagramCommand.collectFeatureValues(): now uses instanceof FeatureValue
- DiagramCommand.findView(): now uses instanceof ViewDefinition / ViewUsage
- DiagramCommand.getExposedElements(): now uses instanceof Expose
- ViewsCommand.collectViews(): now uses instanceof ViewDefinition / ViewUsage
- ViewsCommand.listChildren(): now uses instanceof Expose

6. [FIXED] Hardcoded reference name "importedElement" in two places

Both DiagramCommand.getExposedElements() and ViewsCommand.listChildren() now cast to Expose (which extends Import) and call expose.getImportedElement() directly. The EReference loop and string lookup are eliminated.

7. [FIXED] SysMLStandaloneSetup.doSetup() via Class.forName()

No Class.forName() call exists in the codebase. SysMLEngineHelper uses SysMLInteractive.createInstance(), which handles all Xtext/EMF standalone setup (KerMLStandaloneSetup, SysMLxStandaloneSetup, SysMLStandaloneSetup) internally. This finding was already resolved.

LOW — Acceptable but worth noting
8. getOwnedMember() reflection with fallback to eContents()

This is done safely — if the method isn't found, eContents() is used. The fallback is semantically reasonable. Still, if the generated model interface has getOwnedMember() as a public method, using it directly would be cleaner.

9. getType() reflection in ViewsCommand.getTypeAnnotation()

Called silently — returns empty string on failure. Acceptable as decorative information, but worth using the generated accessor if available.

10. Issue diagnostics reflection in ValidateCommand

Tries getMessage(), getLineNumber()/getLine(), getColumn()
